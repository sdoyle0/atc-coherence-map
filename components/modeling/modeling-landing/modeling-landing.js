                    College- and career-ready standards give modeling extra emphasis in high school for good reasons. Modeling is the link between the mathematics students learn in school and the problems they will face in college, career, and life. Time spent on modeling in high school is crucial as it prepares students to use math to handle technical subjects in their further studies, and problem solve and make decisions that adults need to make regularly in their lives.
